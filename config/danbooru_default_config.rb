# This file contains all the configuration settings for Danbooru.
#
# Don't edit this file. Instead, to configure your Danbooru instance, copy this
# file to config/danbooru_local_config.rb and edit that. Remove all settings you
# don't need to change, and edit only the settings you do need to change.
#
# You can also use environment variables to change settings on the command line.
# For example, to change the site name, you could do:
#
#     DANBOORU_APP_NAME=MyBooru bin/rails server
#
# This works with nearly any setting. Just take the setting name, uppercase it,
# and add DANBOORU_ to the front. More examples:
#
#     DANBOORU_CANONICAL_URL=https://booru.example.com
#     DANBOORU_CONTACT_EMAIL=admin@booru.example.com
#     DANBOORU_DISCORD_SERVER_URL=https://discord.gg/yourbooru
#
# Settings from environment variables will override those from the config file.
#
# You can also set these environment variables in an envfile instead of the
# command line. See the .env file in the root project directory for details.
